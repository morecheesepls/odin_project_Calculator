# odin_project_Calculator
Calculator Project in the Odin Project Foundations Course

Warning
Before you get started with the project, we need to cover a word of warning. As you look into how to evaluate complex mathematical statements in JavaScript, you will likely come across the tantalizing eval() function. However, this function can be very dangerous and MDN does a good job documenting why you should never use eval! You’ll need to build your own functions to evaluate expressions as part of this project. On the same note, when researching how to calculate expressions, you may encounter solutions that suggest that you return a new Function() that evaluates a string. Similarly to eval(), this should not be used due to potential pitfalls of evaluating insecure data. Besides, where’s the fun in solutions that do all the work for you? Let’s get to it!


DO NOT USE
use eval()
return a new Function() that evaluates a string
